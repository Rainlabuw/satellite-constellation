    Initializing this directory.

    Wanted to determine smaller scale constellation that would still be fully connected - settled on 10x10 w 4000km link distance after experiments.

    Generate 10 sims of 1000 timesteps each for 1,000,000 total training timesteps. (standard haal_experiment1 orbital parameters.)
    Saved as data/benefits_list.pkl, etc.

    HAAL experiment 1 has an average task in view of 8.67, and experiment 2 has avg. 14.4. Thus, I think M=10 for a constellation of 10x10 should be fine.

    IDEA: when we have these benefit matrices, convolve both in the task direction and in the agent direction. This can hopefully help us capture
    things like "how many tasks are available for this agent" and "how many other agents can do this task?"
