    Initializing this directory.

    Wanted to determine smaller scale constellation that would still be fully connected - settled on 10x10 w 4000km link distance after experiments.

    Generate 10 sims of 1000 timesteps each for 1,000,000 total training timesteps. (standard haal_experiment1 orbital parameters.)
    Saved as data/benefits_list.pkl, etc.
