Instructions on getting access to repo.

1. Find a location in your compute for the repo
2. Type `git clone https://github.com/Rainlabuw/satellite-constellation.git`
    This creates a local repo on your computer of the origin main repo. 
3. Type `git fetch origin main`.
    This updates your origin/main branch so you're up-to-date with all changes in the remote origin main (e.g. someone updated the main branch recently).
